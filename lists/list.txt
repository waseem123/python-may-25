LIST -
    list is a collection of elements.
    It is an ordered, indexed and mutable collection
    that allows the repeated values.

How to create a list?
Method 1 - 
listname = [value1, value2, value3...valueN]

Method 2 (Using list constructor) - 
listname = list((value1,value2,value3,... valueN))

1. Length of the list - 
    No. of elements present in the list
2. Index - 
    Programmatic address of each element in the list
LISTS are indexed
    where index starts from zero and ends on length-1

LISTS are mutable-
    -We can add new values in the list
    -We can change any value from the list
    -We can delete any value from the list
    -We can clear the entire list
    -We can delete the list
    -We can sort the list
    -We can extend the list

    range(1,100)
